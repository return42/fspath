After 10 years juggling with os.path, zipfile & Co. I thought it is time to
bring back more *pythonic* to APIs. It is made with the philosophy that API's
should be intuitive and their defaults should at least cover 80% of what
programmer daily needs.  Started with the semantic file system pathes, it grows
continuous and includes more and more handy stuff for the daily python
scripting.
